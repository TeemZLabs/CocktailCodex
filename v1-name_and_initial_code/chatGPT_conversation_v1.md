**The code of one page website, with an icon, the name and the slogan of the bar at the top.**

**The user selects the base alcohol of his cocktail by clicking on the corresponding button.**

**A cocktail recipe (cocktail name, ingredients, instructions) containing this alcohol is then automatically generated by requesting the OpenAI API.** 

**An image of the cocktail is generated by interacting with the DALL-E API, asking an image corresponding to the cocktail name**

**The cocktail recipe and the cocktail image are then displayed below.**

>Here is a sample HTML code for a one-page website that displays the bar name, slogan, and allows users to select >the base alcohol of their cocktail. This code will also generate a cocktail recipe and image using the OpenAI and >DALL-E APIs:
>
>```javascript

>  <title>The Cocktail Codex</title>
>  <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="icon.png">

>          const imageResponse = fetch(`https://api.openai.com/v1/images/generate?model=image-alpha-001&prompt=$>{cocktailName}`);

**how can I test this code ?**

>To test this code, you can do the following:
>
>1. Copy the code and paste it into a text editor. Save the file with an .html extension, for example >"cocktail-generator.html".
>2. Find an image that you'd like to use as the icon for the website and save it as "icon.png" in the same >directory as the HTML file.
>3. Open the HTML file in a web browser. You should see the bar name and slogan at the top of the page, and four >buttons representing the different base alcohols.
>4. Click on one of the buttons to generate a cocktail recipe and image. If everything is working correctly, you >should see the cocktail recipe and image displayed on the page.
>
