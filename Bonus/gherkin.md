**In Gherkhin :**

**The code of one page website, with an icon, the name and the slogan of the bar at the top.**

**The user selects the base alcohol of his cocktail by clicking on the corresponding button.**

**A cocktail recipe (cocktail name, ingredients, instructions) containing this alcohol is then automatically generated by requesting the OpenAI API.** 

**An image of the cocktail is generated by interacting with the DALL-E API, asking an image corresponding to the cocktail name**

**The cocktail recipe and the cocktail image are then displayed below.**

>As Gherkin language is used to write feature file in BDD, it's not the correct syntax to present a full functionality of a webpage. However, I could guide you to write the feature of this webpage functionality in Gherkin:
>
>Feature: One page website for Cocktail recipe generation
>
>  As a user
>
>  I want to be able to select the base alcohol for my cocktail
>
>  And receive a recipe for a cocktail containing that alcohol
>
>  And an image of the cocktail generated from the recipe
>
>Scenario: Select base alcohol and receive cocktail recipe and image
>
>  Given I am on the homepage of the website
>
>  When I see the icon, the name and the slogan of the bar at the top
>
>  And I click on the corresponding button to select the base alcohol
>
>  Then the cocktail recipe containing this alcohol is generated by requesting the OpenAI API
>
>  And an image of the cocktail is generated by interacting with the DALL-E API
>
>  And the cocktail recipe and the cocktail image are displayed below.
>
>You can expand on this feature file by adding more scenarios and steps.
>
>Keep in mind that Gherkin language is used to describe a feature in plain text understandable by both developer >and non-developer, so there are no technical details in the feature file.

Could you detail the scenario ?

>Certainly, here's an example of a scenario that could be used to test the functionality of the one-page website for generating cocktail recipes:
>
>Scenario: Selecting a base alcohol and receiving a cocktail recipe and image
>
>    Given I am on the homepage of the website
>
>    When I see the icon, the name and the slogan of the bar at the top
>
>    And I select the button for "Rum" as the base alcohol
>
>    Then a cocktail recipe for a "Daiquiri" containing rum, lime juice, and simple syrup is displayed
>
>    And an image of a "Daiquiri" cocktail is displayed
>
>    And the recipe includes instructions for how to prepare the cocktail.
>
>This scenario describes the basic flow of using the website: the user navigates to the homepage, selects "Rum" as the base alcohol, and is presented with a recipe for a "Daiquiri" cocktail along with an image of the drink. Note that this is just an example, the recipe and the image can change based on the selection of the user.
>
>It's important to note that this is a simplified scenario to show how the feature works, the real-world scenario could be more complex with more conditions and actions. Also, this scenario uses hardcoded values such as name of cocktail "Daiquiri" and the ingredients, it's just for the demonstration purpose, in real world scenario it would be generated by API calls.
